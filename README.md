## CSE343 Spring 2022 - Team NULL

## Description
Welcome to our GitHub repository for Gebze Technical University's Software Engineering course, CSE343.

## Project
**Here** is an attendance taking and tracking application. Its basic mechanism is to display a QR
code by a host and scan it by students. That makes attendance easier for everyone. With Here,
teachers can take attendance without counting the class or circulating a sheet in class. And
students certainly know in which weeks they attend to the class.
